##Description

This is a simple physics based game that grew out of pong.
For now it is a (very) rough prototype with a very basic start and pause menu.

Eventually those will be replaced by stunningly beautiful menu screens that will revolutionize
the way people discover, enjoy and share menu screens.

Also there will be powerups and nicer graphics.

Be prepared.


##Controls
left player uses w, a, s, d for movement and q and e for rotation
right player uses up, down, left, right for movement and , and . for rotation.

The keys can be changed in the "keys.lua" file in the same directory that contains the "main.lua"
