This is a simple physics based game that grew out of pong.
For now it is a (very) rough prototype with a very basic start and pause menu.

Eventually those will be replaced by stunningly beautiful menu screens that will revolutionize
the way people discover, enjoy and share menu screens.

Also there will be powerups and nicer graphics.

Be prepared.
